    \item 48 years old 
    \item Has a wife of 25 years 
    \item Inherited the farm from his farther 
    \item Owns a small farm 2 fields both around 2 hectares each and some farm animals
    \item Pretty good at mathematics
    \item Graduated farming school
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We went to Hans at his farm, we meet his wife who took us to him in the farm house, where he was feeding his cows.
    \item He seemed to enjoy doing this, but quickly finished up, and we returned to their house.
    \item  We talked to him about how much resources and work he uses for each of his fields and told him about the FSP(Field statistics program), which would aim to provide a easy way to gain overview of the resources the field needs.
    \item He told us that he has worked the fields since his birth which gives him a pretty good understanding of how much work and resources they take, and that any deviation from this normally came from factors that are unpredictable.
    \item  Because of this he did not feel the need to use the program at first, but said he was able to see the usefulness if used in a bigger farm, with more stuff needing to be monitored.
\end{enumerate}
