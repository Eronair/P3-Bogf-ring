The third semester of the software bachelor at AAU, has a curriculum that aims to express the purpose of the P3-project and therefore this report.

The purpose being:
\begin{quotation}
Den studerende skal opnå viden om problemstillinger og fundamentale teknikker i udvikling af applikationer til løsning af realistiske opgaver; og opnå erfaring med udvikling af store systemer, arbejdsdeling og kvalitetskontrol herunder aftestning og afprøvning.
\end{quotation}

Translated:
\begin{quotation}
The student must acquire knowledge about problems and fundamental techniques in the development of applications in the pursuit of solving realistic problems; and acquire experience in developing large systems, work distribution and quality control including trial and testing.
\end{quotation}

In parallel with the P3-project, courses in Systems Development, Algorithms and Datastructures and Design and Evaluation of User Interfaces were held. We will use the knowledge gained from these courses to enhance and ensure the quality of the report and subsequent program.

A requirement for this project is that we, as a group, work together with, and develop a solution for, a user and describe the essential parts of the process.
