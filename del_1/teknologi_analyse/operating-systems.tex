In this section we will figure out what OS (Operating System) that are available for tablets nowadays and what makes the individual OS great and/or bad. This section should help us towards picking a final OS on which our application would be developed for. 
A very big part of the tablet is the Operating system (OS). There's quite a bunch of different OS's we will be listing the most popular systems and explain what makes them individually good or bad.

\textbf{iOS}\newline
The most recent version of Apple's iOS as of this time of writing is iOS 10. It is developed by the American hardware \& software manufacturer Apple. iOS is an operating system that is being used by all of Apple's mobile products, such as their iPad and iPhone products. iOS 10 was released September 13th\cite{macworld:iosreleasedate} with much criticism and complaints from apple-fans and critics alike. Apple made a lot of drastic changes to features such as the lock-screen that many users didn't agree with. Looking past the recent criticisms Apple has made a very robust operating system that does everyday tasks quickly and is very intuitive to use. Their main focus has been on usability and useability rather than extendability and customization. It is a closed system, which means that Apple have locked users away from their local file system except for personal files such as photos, videos, music files etc. Because of this, iOS is also almost safe for viruses and hacking attacks, though there have been popping up more and more exploits\cite{xiao:claud} with each iteration of the system. 
From a development standpoint iOS has previously had a relatively high barrier to entry, since you couldn't just freely build software onto an Apple iOS product. You had to have a registered Apple Developer account, where the cheapest version currently is \$99 USD for a years developer membership. But now Apple offer a student programme and anyone with an Apple ID can build and upload an application to their personal iOS device. You won't be able to upload to Apple's App Store without having a registered developer account\cite{apple:developerprogram}.

Android has traditionally named their versions after sweets or cakes, which is also apparent in the most recent iteration, Android 7.0 "Nougat", released the 22. of August 2016\cite{android:latest_version}. Android is the most widely used tablet OS in 2016 \cite{netmarketshare:tablet_os}, and furthermore has the second largest diversity of manufacturers (13 and 194 different models in the source \cite{edbpriser:android}), only surpassed by Windows. Android was originally developed by Android Inc, but was bought by Google in 2005\cite{uk.complex:google_buys_android}, and has been continually developed by them since then. Android is known for its increased customizability compared to iOS
